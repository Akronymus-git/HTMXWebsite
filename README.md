# Overview

This is a small hobby project for developing a website, mostly written in F#.

# Goals

- Have the website working fully without JS 
  - JS only for enhancement, ideally mainly through HTMX.
- Write all middlewares I want to use myself at first
  - Maybe replacing middlewares I already implemented later on
- Serve as a way to host various utilities for acquaintances
